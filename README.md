# Supervised-learning-projects
poject - 1 : I started with first visualizing the dataset through graph plots and see the correlation among them to better understand which variable to take for training my models 

project - 2 : I manually tired to convert my numerical data to categorical data and applied t-test to check for significant difference between the means of two groups. Similarly applied f-oneway-test for more category. After preprocessing the data I applied Linear Regression and calculated root mean square error

poject - 3 : I applied different models to my dataset and claculated root mean square error for them 

CLassification and Regression project : I applied different classification and regression for two different dataset
